<h1>Security Assessment of Jay's Past Projects</h1>
<p>Prepared by <a href="jbrill01.github.io">Jason Brillon</a> • 11/28/2014</p>
</br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This assessment tests the vulnerability and security of a <a href="http://shrouded-ocean-3871.herokuapp.com">Location Database Heroku App</a> made by Jay Destories.</p>
</br>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>I first carried out "black-box" attacks with curl. I performed cross-site scripting, request injection attacks, and inputted falsified coordinates, but I could think of little else to do without looking at the source code (I also lost time testing for things that weren't problems - i.e. malformed JSON). After looking at the source code, I had more success and was able to…</p>
</br>
<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
<h2>Issues Found</h2>
<h4>1. Cross-Site Scripting</h4><ul>
<li>Issue: Cross-Site Scripting</li>
<ul><li>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is when the server takes in javascript as data and subsequently executes it.</li></ul>
<li>Location: POST /sendLocation</li>
<ul><li>Specifically, the three parameters taken in on POST (login, lat and lng) are neither regulated nor escaped. Therefore, anything – such as code contained in script tags – can be read in.</li></ul>
<li>Severity of Issue: <span class="severe">High</span>
<ul><li>XSS is often ranked among the top security threats to websites, and that's because the Javascript taken in can do virtually anything, from alert messages (which I chose to do), to redirecting the window to corrupt websites.</ul></li>
<li>Proof of Vulnerability</li>
<ul><li>This is the alert message I put up on Jay's page</li><div class="alert"></div></ul>
<li>Resolution</li>
<ul><li>Possible resolutions including limiting the input to alphanumerical only, or more preferably changing questionable characters into HTML versions (i.e. angle-brackets can become &amp;lt; and &amp;gt;).</li></ul></ul>
</br>
<h4>2. Request Injection</h4><ul>
<li>Issue: Request Injection Attack</li>
<ul><li>A request injection attack is when the a request.</li></ul>
<li>Location: GET /locations.json</li>
<ul><li>Specifically, the query that is taken in on GET is capable of taking in [$gt] and [$ne]. The first will return all data after a given input, and the second will return all data that is not a given input.</li></ul>
<li>Severity of Issue: <span class="severe">High</span>
<ul><li>In this particular scenario, all database information is revealed just by pairing [$gt] with a blank input, or by pairing [$ne] with an input not in the database. Therefore, so long as you know the name of the requested query parameter and regardless of whether you know anything about the database itself, you can get the returned information for all members of the database.</ul></li>
<li>Proof of Vulnerability</li>
<ul><li>Below are two examples of this error: a [$gt] that returns all data, and an [$ne] that returns all data except for input "test4".</li><div class="reqInject"></div><div class="reqInject req2"></div></ul>
<li>Resolution</li>
<ul><li>?</li></ul></ul>
</br><h4>4. Non-numerical Inputs</h4><ul>
<li>Issue: Non-numerical Inputs</li>
<ul><li>Latitude and longitude should be numerical inputs (i.e. 43.21 or -123.45). However, Jay's application can take any input (as seen with issue number one), not just numerical ones.</li></ul>
<li>Location: POST /sendLocation</li>
<ul><li>When taking in the three parameters on POST (login, lat and lng), lat and lng have no regulations about what they have to be. Therefore, they are not limited to numerical characters.</li></ul>
<li>Severity of Issue: <span class="weak">Low</span>
<ul><li>Beyond potentially crowding the database with input much longer than a standard lat and lng, the biggest problem this causes is a list of locations that are not actually locations. For instance, some of the locations on Jay's app are now just random characters, or they are blank. Ming noted this when storing a lat of "this" and a lng of "isbad".</ul></li>
<li>Proof of Vulnerability</li>
<ul><li>Here are two example non-numerical inputs from Jay's page</li><div class="non-num"></div></ul></ul>
<li>Resolution</li>
<ul><li>One possible resolution would be to create an additional if statement, and say that if (isNaN(the inputted lat) || isNaN(the inputted lng)), send an error and do not store the input in the database </li></ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
