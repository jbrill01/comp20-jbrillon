README for Assignment Three: whereintheworld

* All of the parts of this assignment have been correctly implemented. In terms of error handling, I decided to return a response of 500 if parts one or four were to go wrong. Part two returns empty brackets, as specified.

* I collaborated with my comp 20 group when trying to get the project started, because I did not know how to set up mongodb on heroku (because of the credit card thing, etc.). That alone took around 1.5 to 2 hours to solve.

* After set-up, the rest of the assignment took an additional three or four hours to complete, with much of that spent on part one and part four. Parts two and three came together pretty quickly after making part one.
