README for Comp 20, Assignment Two

This project simulates a map similar to The Marauders Map. It parses JSON response data and uses the Google Maps API to put different students' and characters' locations on the map. It also calculates distances and draws polylines from my character to others.

I reached out to Ryan Havens for advice about how to set up an associative array.

The assignment took roughly 6.5 hours from start to finish.
