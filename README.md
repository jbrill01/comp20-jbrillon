**Git Repository for Comp20: Web Programming**
==========================================

### Purpose
* This is my private repository for Comp20. In it, you can find different projects that I've completed over the course of
the semester.
* The repository includes four assignments, as well as several smaller assignments. The assignments were completed independently, and they make use of the topics learned in the course.

### Favorite Assignment
* My favorite assignment from this course is the "security" assignment. I liked the opportunity to try and find weaknesses in our past assignments, learn from those weaknesses, and figure out how to better account for security threats. 


### Personal Development
* I think I've grown a lot from Day 1. Upon entering the course, I knew a little bit of client-side, but not enough to do anything legitimate. Now, I have a much more solidified understanding of html/css/js, as well as ideas like responsiveness, browser-compatability etc. (For example, I made this [website](http://tupboard.github.io)). I also knew little about server-side and back-end, outside of basic knowledge of sql. Having had the chance to work with nosql databases and with frameworks like nodeJS, I was able to contribute to [a group project](http://flexcalibr-app.herokuapp.com) that used a database and a computer-game framework.

### Big Ideas
* The biggest takeaway from this course, for me, was 

### Next Steps
* After this course, I want to test out different, commonly-used languages and frameworks (ruby, rails, etc.). I also want to go deeper into the topic of security, ideally taking Tufts' security course and going to DEFCON and the like. Mostly, I'll keep playing around with UI and UX because those are the topics that I most enjoy.
