responsive

This assignment is entitled "Responsive" and it is meant to include an
index.html and a responsive.css

The goal of the project is to have the html document respond to different sizes
of browsers through the css media queries.

No collaboration was made when working on this assignment, and upon testing it,
it seems to have worked.

Roughly a half-hour was spent on the assignment.

An additional ten or fifteen minutes was spent with Ming, trying to help me
with my git issues.
